A barrier is a simple concept. Also known as a rendezvous, it is a synchronization point between multiple threads. The barrier is configured for a particular number of threads (n), and as threads reach the barrier they must wait until all n threads have arrived. Once the n-th thread has reached the barrier, all the waiting threads can proceed, and the barrier is reset.
